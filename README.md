# docker-files

## Some of the docker-compose files I use

I usually place all my folders in `/docker`

If you want to use these docker files, either follow the same folder structure or change the paths in the docker-compose files.

Also make sure to replace `REPLACE_ME` with your own values

There are some networks that are created manually with `docker network create REPLACE_ME`

### Tools

Files in `_tools` are not directly services, but are used to run commands on the host machine for deployment
